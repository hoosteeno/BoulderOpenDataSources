# BoulderOpenDataSources

## Let's make Boulder's open data better. ##

The Knight Foundation, Code for America and Sunlight Foundation put together an [open data census](http://us-city.census.okfn.org/) that audits U.S. municipalitiies' open data. Boulder has ranked low in this census. In some cases, this is because nobody has updated the census site. In other cases we need to encourage our government organizations share this data. This repository is devoted to that effort.

Current activity: Audit Boulder's open data sources using the tools below; update it, or submit open data requests.

We may one day wish to segment this information into more files, or to include general tools (such as scrapers) in this repository.
